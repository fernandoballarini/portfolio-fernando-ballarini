    <h1>Hi, I'm Fernando Ballarini</h1>
    <p>
      I am a passionate software engineer with experience in .NET, Angular, and cloud technologies.
      I love building scalable solutions and collaborating with teams to deliver high-quality products.

    <p>
      As a senior software engineer with over a decade of experience in backend development (C#
      .NET, Azure, CI/CD, microservices, Docker, Kubernetes), I’m driven by the challenge of
      crafting clean, scalable systems that genuinely improve users’ lives. What energizes me
      most, though, is working in teams where curiosity, ownership, and a pursuit of excellence
      are part of the culture.

    <p>
     While my core strength is backend and infrastructure, I bring a full-stack perspective through
     hands-on experience with Angular and Vue.js. I’ve partnered closely with UX and product
     teams to create data-rich dashboards and intuitive tools, always striving to understand not
     just what we’re building, but why. That mindset has allowed me to influence everything from
     architecture and process improvements to the user experience.
